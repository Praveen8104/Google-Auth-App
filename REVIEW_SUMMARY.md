## Detailed Comments by File

### `App.js`

| Line | Severity | Comment |
|------|----------|---------|
| 2 | 💡 suggestion | Consider using a linter to ensure consistent naming conventions. |
| 7 | ⚠️ warning | Check if the App function is properly exported in other parts of the codebase. |
| 11 | 💡 suggestion | Consider adding a default font size or family to avoid potential accessibility issues. |
| 17 | 💡 suggestion | Consider using a more specific color for the background, as '#fff' might not be accessible for all users. |

### `app.json`

| Line | Severity | Comment |
|------|----------|---------|
| 4 | 💡 suggestion | Consider using a more descriptive slug name instead of just 'GoogleAuth' |
| 5 | 💡 suggestion | The version number should be updated regularly, consider using semantic versioning |
| 12 | ⚠️ warning | Resizing the splash image may cause issues on different devices, consider adding a fallback or checking device capabilities first |
| 15 | 💡 suggestion | Enabling newArchEnabled might require additional configuration for certain platforms, ensure proper testing and handling of edge cases |

### `index.js`

| Line | Severity | Comment |
|------|----------|---------|

### `package.json`

| Line | Severity | Comment |
|------|----------|---------|
| 1 | 💡 suggestion | Missing `type` field for JavaScript package. Recommended: `module` or `commonjs`. |
| 6 | ⚠️ warning | Using exact version (`~54.0.10`) may lead to unexpected behavior when a newer version is released. Consider using a range (e.g., `^54.0.10` or `<54.1.0`). |
| 8 | ⚠️ warning | Using exact versions for `expo-status-bar` and other dependencies may lead to unexpected behavior when a newer version is released. Consider using a range (e.g., `^3.0.8` or `<3.1.0`). |
| 12 | ⚠️ warning | Using exact versions for `react` and other dependencies may lead to unexpected behavior when a newer version is released. Consider using a range (e.g., `^19.1.0` or `<20.0.0`). |
| 14 | ⚠️ warning | Using exact versions for `react-native` and other dependencies may lead to unexpected behavior when a newer version is released. Consider using a range (e.g., `^0.81.4` or `<0.82.0`). |
